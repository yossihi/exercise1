        <dd>Israel is a small, narrow, semi-arid country on the southeastern
             coastline of the Mediterranean Sea. It entered history some 35 
             centuries ago when the Jewish people forsook its nomadic way of 
             life, settled in the Land and became a nation.

        <dd>The United States of America is the world's third largest country
             in size and nearly the third largest in terms of population. 
             Located in North America, the country is bordered on the west by 
             the Pacific Ocean and to the east by the Atlantic Ocean. Along the
              northern border is Canada and the southern border is Mexico.
